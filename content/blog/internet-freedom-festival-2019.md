## Registration

This was one of the most weird an uncomfortable conferences I went to. At the registration phase, where I had to get my bracelet, I sat through a reading of the rules, it was a personal reading, even though the rules were available online and they linked to them a few times in the emails. All of the rules can be resumed by saying: "Don't be an asshole!". But this was my first contact with the actual conference. Sitting through that reading saying things like:
- Do not sexual harass;
- Do not drug the food and drinks;
- Do not bully people;
- Do not tweet, take pictures, or publish anything about the attendees or the speakers (even though their details were on the website as speakers);

Here is the full list: https://www.internetfreedomfestival.org/wiki/index.php/Code_of_Conduct

It made me wonder what kind of people attend this conference which have to be told not to do all these things. The organizers value "safe spaces" but this intro already made me feel uneasy.

Apart from that I had to have a name tag with me and visible all the time which included my name and my preferred pronoun. Not having the tag with me meant I was going to be kicked out. People were not allowed to address others without checking the tag first, nobody was allowed to assume gender, even if it was obvious. 

They also had 3 therapists who offered 30 minute sessions in case "you got triggered" (this is a direct quote).

The talks themselves had a few recurring themes: censorship and fake media, privacy and armies of trolls which I am going to detail a bit.

## Censorship and fake media
Journalists can have a censorship problem in some countries (i.e. China, Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan) which means they cannot post what they want from within the country and if they operate from outside of the country their website is banned. A few solutions they discussed were how to use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram or communication channels like Telegram, Whatsapp or even Medium to spread their news to the people still inside the country. They contemplated using static content or other publishing platforms, ones like Wordpress, Jekyll.

Fake media meant that you are allowed to publish what you want but you are buried in the huge quantity of other news who optimize for clicks and can have inaccurate or false content. People fall victim to their own humanity by making the useless or even detrimental content popular, which in addition will be spread by social media algorithms to more and more people.

## Privacy

Privacy was another big theme of the conference. People do not want to be tracked, this means cookie tracking, GDPR, identity management. In some cases it makes a lot of sense. If you are a journalist which is posting controversial content about a country who is doing a lot of censorship. Also if you consider your personality and political affiliation will be analyzed to be influenced in the future.

But there was one think I consider it was not correctly perceived, which is tracking for ads. People unknowingly agreed to a free Internet but selling their attention to ad providers. The sites are free because their only source of income is selling ads. And banning those ads, or making it harder to sell to us will cut that source of funding for the websites, which effectively means they have to shut down. I do not know if people will ever want to pay for subscriptions. 

## Armies of trolls

The armies of trolls seemed to one of the very big problems the community had, which is linked to the safe space they also talked about. Unfortunately there were no definitions about what any of these are. I guess I will never know and honestly I was too afraid to ask.
