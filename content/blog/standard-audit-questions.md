With every audit there should be a meeting where you get to know the client and the system. Because most of the things I have to ask the client are standard, I used to have a private list of questions. I want to share that list with you.

Having a list also helps you remove assumptions that you create about the system or the team, which usually leads to problems. In security you want to make the least amount of assumptions as possible and this should not be limited to code and technology. The design of the system and the team's security expertise is important.

- What do you care about most?
- What things did you implement before and what was new for the team?
- Do you have a disaster plan?
  - When was the last time you tested the plan?
- Who will interact with the system?
  - Who has the highest privilege access and how do you protect that?
- How much security background does your team have?
- What are the system's assets?
  - Make sure to ask about personal / sensitive information.
  - This will also relay how much knowledge they actually have.
  - What amount of funds will the system hold?
- Will you upgrade the system?
  - What is that process?
  - How often?
- How complex is the system?
- What security measures did you take until now?
  - Did you run any tools?
  - Did somebody else review the system?
